# Duplicate Number Analyzer

## Description

A simple Python command-line tool that allows users to input a list of numbers, check for duplicates, and determine if each number is a palindrome. This project showcases my proficiency in applying `list`, `tuples`, `if statements`, `for loops`, and the `enumerate` function, as well as skills from solving `LeetCode` problems like `Contain Duplicate` and `Palindrome Number`.

## Features

*  Collects numbers and stores them in a `list` of `tuples` (numbers, palindrome status).
*  Uses `for loops` to process inputs and check for duplicates.
*  Employs `enumerate` to number entries in the output for clarity.
*  Applies `if statements` to validate inputs (e.g, handling negative numbers) and identify palindromes.
*  Display the list with the status of palindromes and indicate if duplicates exist.

## Skill Demonstration

*  `Lists and Tuples`: Stores numbers and their palindrome status in a `list` of `tuples` for organized data management.
*  `If Statements`: Validates inputs (e.g., handling negative numbers) and determines palindrome status using conditional logic.
*  `for Loops`: Iterates over inputs to collect data and over the `list` to check for duplicates and display results.
*  `enumerate Function`: Numbers each entry in the output, enhancing readability and demonstrating index tracking.
*  `LeetCode Skills`: Applies logic from `Contain Duplicate` (checking for repeated numbers) and `Palindrome Number` (reversing digits to check palindrome) to pratical tool.
